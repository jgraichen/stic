  # A Generator generates blobs or specific subclasses
  # based on some input.
  #
  # As an example see Stic::Generators::Static that
  # generates blobs for static files.

  # A generator will be initialized by the system and it's
  # `run` method will be invoked. The generator now can add
  # blobs to the `site`. Subclass must override the `run`
  # method providing custom logic.

    # class name as an underscore string with `Generator`
    # striped from the end.
